        <p className="margin-bottom-20">
          We will only collect personal information where such information is
          reasonably necessary for us to undertake our functions and activities.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-bottom-20">
          Generally, we collect personal information when you enquire or make a
          booking with us. We may also collect personal information when you
          email us, write to us, call us or register with us for newsletters or
          connect via social media with us. They type of personal information we
          may collect includes but is not limited to name, address, telephone
          number, email, credit card details, passport information, frequent
          flyer information and any other details that may be relevant to the
          service we provide to you.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-bottom-20">
          In certain circumstances, we may collect sensitive information about
          you such as financial information, ethnic origin, religious beliefs or
          health information. We will only collect sensitive information with
          your consent and where it is reasonably necessary or directly related
          to the provision of our services.

          In certain circumstances we may receive personal information about
          third parties from individuals, when making a booking with us. An
          example of this would be where a booking is made on behalf of other
          individuals (such as for family members) and personal information is
          required. It will be deemed that where this occurs, we rely on the
          authority of the person making the travel booking to act on behalf of
          any other traveller on the booking and that in providing this
          information to us, all individuals are consenting to their personal
          information being collected and used in accordance with this Privacy
          Policy.
