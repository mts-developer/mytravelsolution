## Running the application

`cd` to the `/client` directory and type `npm start`
The front-end runs on `localhost:3000`

# Developer Principles

- Each component must be separated into their own folders and contain proprietary `.css` and `.test.js` files.

```
MenuBar/
  menuBar.css
  MenuBar.js
  menuBar.test.js
  index.js
```
